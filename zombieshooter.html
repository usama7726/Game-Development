		<p>
			“Zombie Shooter” is a 2D platform game with a goal to defend the city from a horde of zombies trying to eat you and everyone else. There will be a zombie counter to count how many zombies did you kill. When you kill 100 zombies you will reach level 10 and finish the game. There will also be a timer to show the time in which you have to survive against the zombies. If you are alive when the timer runs out then you will win the level.
