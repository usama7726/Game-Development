            <h1>Monetization and Marketing Strategy</h1>
            <dl>
                <dt>1. Business Model:</dt><br>
                    <ul type="circle">
                        <li>Fremium</li>
                        <dd>We will use fremium business model for our game. In this model, we will use in-game purchases in which the player will have to pay in order to continue the game.</dd><br>
                        <dd> Main levels in the game, i.e., to collect gun, knife, and pan. After the basic understanding of game, the player will move to achieve goals in the game. The first element will be collected by the character free of cost. But in case, the energy boosts of characters are finished or used already, the player will have to pay to buy energy boosts for the survival of the character. </dd><br>
                        <dd>When the first element is collected, the game interface will notify the player to buy the other assets and continue the game. If player ignore the notification, the game will continue with limited features and the chance to complete the game will be minimum.</dd><br>
                        <dd>So, the player will pay for next levels because collection of the next two elements is mandatory in order to complete the game. This is the way, we setup our business model to earn from the game.</dd>
                    </ul>
                <br>
                <dt>2. Marketing Strategy:</dt>
                <dd>Creating, developing and launching our game is only the beginning of our quest. If we donâ€™t have a good video game marketing strategy in place, our game will get lost in the void and all that time, money, and effort will go to waste. The difficulty lies in making our game stand out from the rest and trying to persuade people to download our game to their device.</dd><br>
                <dd>So, we adopt several video game marketing strategies to help boost our download rate and get people talking about our game.

                <li>Game Marketing on YouTube:</li>
                <dd>Creating a promo video to use as a teaser, with the most thrilling or exciting parts of our game, is an excellent way to kick things off. Include great graphics and soundtrack, along with any other important pieces of information that will be attractive to a potential player. Once we have uploaded video, we can add the link to description page on app stores and other social media channels.</dd><br>
                <dd>We can also take advantage of one of YouTube's advertising services where our teaser will appear as a video ad before a requested video is played.</dd><br>

                <li>Game Marketing Through Blogging:</li>
                <dd>Creating a blog on our website is one of the most reliable long-term investments and is beneficial for several reasons. It allows us to:</dd><br>

                <li>Facebook and Instagram Game Marketing:</li>
                    <dd>Knowing that a huge chunk of our target customer range is on Facebook and Instagram on a regular basis should give us some encouragement to try out ad campaigns on these networks.
